# Crack the coding interview

## Description
These are some solutions in golang to problems from the `Crack the coding interview` book.

## What this repo isn't
This repo doesn't show how to implement the correct solutions to each problem, this is just a work in progress while I'm studying the book.
The code found in this repo was created by me and is my version of the solutions. I just thought it may be useful to other people.

# Crack the coding interview

## Description
These are some solutions in golang to problems from the [Crack the coding interview](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/145157827X/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_65fyCb50D487P) book. 

## What this repo isn't
This repo doesn't show how to implement the correct solutions to each problem, this is just a work in progress while I'm studying the book.
The code found in this repo was created by me and is my version of the solutions. I just thought it may be useful to other people.
